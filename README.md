## Strava Analysis Helper 📈  ##
This personal project is a handy tool that summarizes your activities on Strava.<br>
By toggling the Chart Type option, you can choose to view your stats in the following three formats: 
1. Distance🏃: A bar graph showing the total distance covered each week, perfect for tracking progress over time.

2. Pace🕒: A line graph tracing your activities' speeds. We always want to stay on pace! (unlike me during week 4)
