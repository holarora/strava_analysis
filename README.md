## Strava Analysis Helper üìà  ##
This personal project is a handy tool that summarizes your activities on Strava.<br>
As a long time Strava user, I often found it challenging to track my activities and visualize my progress effectively. That is what inspired me to create this project.<br>
By toggling the Chart Type option, you can choose to view your stats in the following three formats: 
1. DistanceüèÉ: A bar graph showing the total distance covered each week, perfect for tracking progress over time.

2. Paceüïí: A line graph tracing your activities' speeds. We always want to stay on pace! (unlike me during week 4)

3. HeatmapüìÖ : A calendar highlighting the days when an activity was recorded. The darker the shade, the greater the distance covered on that day.
